     * distribution. <em>WARNING</em>: this simulation technique can
     * take a very long time. Rejection sampling is also commonly
     * called the acceptance-rejection method or "accept-reject algorithm".
     * It generates sampling values from an arbitrary probability distribution
     * function f(x) by using an instrumental distribution g(x), under the
     * only restriction that {@code f(x) < M g(x)} where
     * {@code M > 1} is an appropriate bound on
     * {@code f(x) / g(x)}.
     * <p>
     * Rejection sampling is usually used in cases where the form of
     * <code>f(x)</code> makes sampling difficult. Instead of sampling
     * directly from the distribution <code>f(x)</code>, we use an envelope
     * distribution <code>M g(x)</code> where sampling is easier. These
     * samples from <code>M g(x)</code> are probabilistically
     * accepted or rejected.
     * <p>
     * This method relates to the general field of Monte Carlo techniques,
     * including Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that also use a proxy
     * distribution to achieve simulation from the target distribution
     * <code>f(x)</code>. It forms the basis for algorithms such as
     * the Metropolis algorithm.
